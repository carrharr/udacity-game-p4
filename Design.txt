DESIGN CHOICES

MODELS

In the model section there's nothing specially weird going on, maybe in the Game
model by having one single game object for a 2 player game, instead of two different
objects sharing a urlsafe_key.

ENDPOINTS

The endpoints are as specified in the rubric, nothing special about them either,
except make_move. This last endpoint is basically the core of the game, doing
lots of things like checking correctness of input or signifiying in a variable
the user symbol. I know this is probably not the best way of doing it, but for now
it works. If required or maybe for love of art, i will separate it into different
functions for easier use and failure contention.

CRON JOBS AND TASKS

Just has a reminder of an active game and the memcache for moves remaining. The
memcache is as a static method for in-game speed while the send_reminder
is done as its own.
